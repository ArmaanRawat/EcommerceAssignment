## Assumptions & Limitations

- The product and category data are fetched from a public API (https://fakestoreapi.in/). If the API is unavailable, product listing will not work.
- No authentication or user accounts are implemented.
- Cart data is stored in localStorage and is not persistent across devices.
- No payment gateway or real checkout process is included (demo only).
- Product images and categories are as provided by the API; no custom content.
- Pagination and infinite scroll are limited by the APIâ€™s response and may not scale to very large datasets.

## Future Improvements

- Add user authentication and user-specific carts/orders.
- Integrate a real payment gateway for checkout.
- Add product reviews and ratings from users.
- Improve error handling and loading states.
- Add admin dashboard for product management.
- Add unit and integration tests.
- Add support for multiple languages and currencies.
- Enhance accessibility and mobile UX further.
- Add product image zoom and gallery features.
- Improve SEO and add meta tags for better sharing.
